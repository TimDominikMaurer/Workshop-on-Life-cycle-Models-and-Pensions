# Workshop-on-Life-cycle-Models-and-Pensions

By [Tim Dominik Maurer](https://www.timdominikmaurer.com/).

Short Description
---------------------
* Lecture 1: The Life-cycle Model
  * We solve and simulate a partial-equilibrium life-cycle model of consumption and saving
* Lecture 2: Structural Estimation
  * We estimate a partial-equilibrium life-cycle model using Simulated Methods of Moments (SMM)
* Lecture 3: The overlapping generations (OLG) Model
  * We solve a general-equilibrium life-cycle model with OLG
* Lecture 4: Pension Policy and Transition Path
  * We use the OLG model to study the effects of pension policy in steady state and during the transition

COURSE PREREQUISITES
---------------------
There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, a basic understanding of the following topics is helpful:
 * Microeconomics and macroeconomics theory and modelling
 * Programming concepts: Data types (e.g. strings, booleans, integers and floats), Data containers (e.g. lists, dicts and arrays), Conditional statements (if-elseif-else), Loops (for, while), (Pseudo) random numbers
 * Numerical optimization
 * Here you can find some helpful links:
